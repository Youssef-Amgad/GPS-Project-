# GPS Project 
## Project Description
### In this project we will develop the following system using TM4C123G LaunchPad:
##### 1. The GPS subsystem stores the coordinates of the start point.
##### 2. After reaching the destination point, the GPS subsystem stores the coordinates of the end point and calculates the total distance that was taken by the user.
### The output will be translated as the following.
####  Stage 1: 
###### The built-in LED will be turned on(green) when the target destination is reached.
####  Stage 2:
###### The built-in LED will be turned on(yellow) when the target destination is about to be reached < 5 meters.
#### Stage 3:
###### The built-in LED will be turned on(red) when the target destination is far away by distance > 5 meters.


## The project is implemented using the following hardware:
#### 1-Tiva-c TM4C123G LaunchPad
#### 2-Gps-module 
#### 3- LCD screen
#### 4- Breadboard
