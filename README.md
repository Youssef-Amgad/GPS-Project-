# GPS Project 🥇 
##              Project Description  🗺️
### In this project we will develop the following system using TM4C123G LaunchPad:
##### 1. The GPS subsystem stores the coordinates of the start point.
##### 2. After reaching the destination point, the GPS subsystem stores the coordinates of the end point and calculates the total distance that was taken by the user.

### Other Options 📺 🔈
##### 1)It displays the distance and notify that we've reached the end point on a LCD screen 
##### 2)It alarms when starting from the initial point  and reaching the end point using amplified Buzzer 


### The output will be translated as the following.
####  Stage 1: 
###### The built-in LED will be turned on(green) when the target destination is reached.🟢
####  Stage 2:
###### The built-in LED will be turned on(yellow) when the target destination is about to be reached < 5 meters.🟡
#### Stage 3:
###### The built-in LED will be turned on(red) when the target destination is far away by distance > 5 meters.🔴



## The project is implemented using the main following hardware:
#### 1-Tiva-c TM4C123G LaunchPad
#### 2-Gps-module 
#### 3- LCD screen
#### 4- Breadboard 
#### 5-Buzzer 
#### 6-Battery 9v
#### 7-Voltage regulator
